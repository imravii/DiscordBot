# DiscordBot

Instructions
Signup with discord (http://discordapp.com).

Create a simple discord bot that would reply hey to your hi.

Add functionality to allow a user to search on google through discord. If the user types !google nodejs, reply with top 5 links that you would get when you search nodejs on google.com

Implement functionality to search through your search history. If a user uses !google to search for "nodejs" "apple games" "game of thrones", and after these searches, if user types !recent game, your bot should reply with "apple games" and "game of thrones"

Make user search history persistent. Use any storage system to store your searches, so even when you kill your nodejs server and start again, your search history is maintained.

You can use any language like Python, Nodejs, Golang etc to implement this.
